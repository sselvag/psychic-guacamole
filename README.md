# Project -02 Recipes for Dinner!

This project creates an application that allows you to save the recipes and go through the steps and ingredients which are needed for the recipes you want for your dinner. Users can choose the recipes they want and save it in their accounts, the ingredients needed for the meals will then be saved in the grocery list.

The application will generate the ingredients you needed and send your a text message via phone.
